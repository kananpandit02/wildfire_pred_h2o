> A multiclass classification project leveraging a **2-node distributed H2O cluster** and a **Distributed Random Forest (DRF)** model to predict wildfire confidence levels using **VIIRS SNPP 2023 global data**.

---

## 📌 Highlights

- 🌍 Used **2023 VIIRS SNPP global wildfire data** from NASA FIRMS  
- 🖥️ Deployed a **2-node H2O cluster** for distributed model training  
- 🌲 Trained a **Distributed Random Forest (DRF)** for **multiclass classification**  
- 📈 Achieved **97.75% accuracy**, AUC of **0.948**  
- 🧪 Includes full **data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and export**  
- 📚 Linked with a detailed PDF **project report** and **cluster setup guide**
