> A multiclass classification project leveraging a **2-node distributed H2O cluster** and a **Distributed Random Forest (DRF)** model to predict wildfire confidence levels using **VIIRS SNPP 2023 global data**.

---

## üìå Highlights
The primary objective of this project is to:
- Build a **high-accuracy wildfire classification system**
- Utilize **distributed computing** to handle large-scale satellite data
- Deploy a **Distributed Random Forest (DRF)** model via H2O.ai
- Evaluate performance using real metrics like **AUC, Accuracy, F1-score**

## üßæ Overview

This project presents a scalable, distributed machine learning solution to predict wildfire confidence levels using satellite data. By leveraging the power of a **2-node H2O.ai distributed cluster**, it processes **2023 global VIIRS SNPP Active Fire data** to classify each fire event into **Low**, **Nominal**, or **High** confidence categories.

The project includes:
- Distributed model training using H2O‚Äôs DRF algorithm
- End-to-end pipeline: preprocessing, training, evaluation
- Real-world application on global fire datasets from NASA FIRMS

## üéØ Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:
- Build a **high-accuracy wildfire classification system**
- Utilize **distributed computing** to handle large-scale satellite data
- Deploy a **Distributed Random Forest (DRF)** model via H2O.ai
- Evaluate performance using real metrics like **AUC, Accuracy, F1-score**
- Enable analysis across all countries using 2023 fire records

## üî• Motivation

With climate change accelerating wildfire incidents worldwide, early detection and classification of fires are critical for emergency response, planning, and resource management. Satellite data, especially from **NASA's VIIRS SNPP**, provides near real-time coverage of global fire events.

However, processing such large datasets requires scalable tools. This motivated the use of:
- **Distributed H2O.ai framework** for handling computation across machines
- **Machine learning** to automate fire classification
- **Open global datasets** for transparency and reproducibility

This project bridges the gap between environmental data availability and real-time decision-making by creating a system that‚Äôs fast, scalable, and accurate.

## üßæ Concluding Remarks

This project demonstrates how distributed machine learning can be effectively applied to real-world environmental challenges like wildfire detection. By combining high-resolution satellite data from NASA FIRMS with H2O.ai‚Äôs scalable distributed computing framework, we achieved robust wildfire confidence prediction across global datasets.

Key highlights include:
- Successful deployment of a 2-node H2O cluster
- High accuracy using a Distributed Random Forest model
- Full pipeline from data ingestion to evaluation
- End-to-end wildfire prediction pipeline using distributed ML.
- Manual model comparison using Random Forest.
- Understanding of H2O AutoML in real-world settings.
- Hands-on experience with H2O cluster setup and orchestration.

This solution can serve as a baseline for building more advanced, real-time wildfire monitoring systems that can support global climate resilience and disaster management efforts.

The methodology, tools, and open datasets used in this project make it not only effective but also reproducible and adaptable for further research, extension, or production use in academic and government settings.
